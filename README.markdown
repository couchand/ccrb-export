CCRB Export
===========

Export the Member of Service Histories from the NYC CCRB.

You can explore the dataset at the city's website: [MOS Records]


Usage
-----

This tool will export the whole dataset.  Try:

```
> cargo run
```

Roadmap
-------

It would be great to clean up the code and make the internals usable
for other purposes besides a full download.
